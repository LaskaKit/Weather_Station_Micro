# Guide to Building an Outdoor Wi-Fi Weather Station with Meteo Mini v3

Thinking about building your own home weather station?  
Weâ€™ve prepared a complete kit that includes a **solar panel**, **enclosure**, **sensors**, **mounting hardware**, and our **Meteo Mini** development board, which you can easily program using **Arduino IDE**.

It features an **ESP32-C3-mimi module** based on the **ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi chip**, equipped with connectors for **IÂ²C**, **SPI**, and **IO** sensors.  
The weather station is powered by a **Li-Pol battery**, connected via a **JST-PH-2 connector** on the main board.  
  
The board also includes an **integrated Li-Pol charger**, allowing the battery to be charged either via a **USB-C connector** or a **solar panel** with a nominal voltage of **5â€“10V**, for which a **JST-PH-2 connector** is also provided on the main board. The board is equipped with a **voltage divider** connected to the battery, with its output linked to the **ADC input** of the microcontroller. This way, the battery status is constantly monitored.

## Instructions for Use

In our detailed guide to building a **micro weather station with Meteo Mini**, youâ€™ll find everything from assembly and programming to setup.  
The sample code uses **WiFi Manager**, which is responsible for the initial configuration of the entire station.  

Simply connect the battery to the **Meteo Mini**, search for the **Wi-Fi network** created by the board, connect to it (AP: `LaskaKitMeteo`), and configure your home Wi-Fi network.
